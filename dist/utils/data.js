The way I work is to treat the cause; I try to get to the bottom of the problem and to get a person’s overall health in shape. In my experience, helping the whole body means that you feel more vital and energised, and the knock-on effect of that is a healthier outlook and a healthier-looking you. You may think that treating the skin topically is the best remedy, but I actually find that the most common causes of skin problems are a liver that isn’t coping, an inflammatory state in the body, hormone imbalance, or a lack of fibre or hydration from within.'

You need to be thinking about supporting the detox process in the liver and in order to do this, you need to give it certain nutrients.'

                text:'Eat your greens! Not only do they provide chlorophyll, which is great for cleansing the blood, but they also contain B vitamins and magnesium, which are beneficial to the nervous system and help relieve stress. Eat lots of brightly coloured fruit and vegetables: these all deliver antioxidants to your lovely liver and help mop up the toxins, leaving the way clear toa brighter outlook. The vitamin C content in the brightly coloured fruit and vegetables is essential for producing collagen, and orange colours are full of beta-carotene and vitamin A, which is often used in creams and is known as retinol. Beetroot, artichoke, and bitter herbs such as rocket, chicory and watercress help the liver to get going, while onion, garlic, leek, cabbage and asparagus are full of sulphur, which also aids the detox process. A happy liver will give you clearer skin and slow down the ageing process, but, more importantly, it will keep toxins down and keep your energy levels up. Many people who feel sluggish have sluggish livers.'

                text:'Tackling inflammation is also crucial when it comes to skin and health. When I say inflammation, I’m talking about any areas of the body that are angry-looking, angry-feeling or swollen. Acne, for instance, is a strong sign of inflammation, as is joint pain. And an inflamed gut can cause inflammation all over the body. If you think this is something that may be affecting you, you should consider calming the body down and soothing it from the inside out, healing the gut so you can absorb more nutrition from your food and also get rid of waste more efficiently. Turmeric, pineapple, papaya and ginger all fight inflammation, as do oily fish, avocados, nuts and seeds. These contain good fats that actually reduce inflammation, and avocados and nuts also contain good amounts of vitamin E. Inflammation causes a lot of free radicals (another term for toxins), so by reducing it we are, again, reducing the toxins in our bodies and helping our internal environment become cleaner and stronger.'

                text:'Most of us know that hydration is really important and works with many other systems to flush out impurities. Combined with fibre, it aids the transit of waste through the body. Talk to any beauty editor or dermatologist and they will tell you that your skin will not look plump and moist if you aren’t hydrated from within. There’s only so much that a moisturiser can do to fill the cracks, so make sure you’re drinking lots of water or herbal teas. It will improve your skin and overall health. Try adding chia seeds to water and then topping up the water as the chia absorbs it. That way you’re taking in more water than you normally would in the same glass (chia can hold ten times its weight in water), and you’re also getting some fibre. Win win!'

                text:'To supplement or not to supplement? Well, it depends if you’re feeling very depleted. I’m a big fan of getting your nutrients from food, but if you need a boost, these are the supplements I’d consider for skin and glow: vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, fish oil such as Eskimo 3. Alpha lipoic acid and glutathione are great antioxidant supplements and can be really helpful if you’re trying to clean up your diet. I’d also look into taking a course of probiotics to help replenish good bacteria and hopefully reduce any baddies that are in your system.'

Oh, and I should add that a night out is actually good for us, too. Having fun releases serotonin, which makes us happy, and if you’re not a night owl then anything that makes you smile will have the same effect. Just remember: beauty from within.'

With Ginsberg is God, there are a couple of pictures: I’ve got a photograph of Hunter S Thompson sitting on the cliffs at Big Sur, with his typewriter, and there’s another picture of Cocteau with a drawing book on his knees — he’s wearing these checkered slipper-boots, and he’s obviously totally engaged. I love the way Cocteau worked, the way he used so many mediums: art, theatre, and dance, and people — he would use everyone to make some kind of story. With 1970, I remember going to Formentera as a child. I was about five. I was aware of this thing that happened in the evening: things would change, there was a bit of frisson, a kind of expectation, and I liked the idea that 1970 would smell of that, that time of day, that moment where something was about to happen. Azzi just seemed to be able to translate that into something you could smell.'

                text:'The signature, the Bella Freud [Eau de Parfum], is more about the private side of me, which Azzi picked up on. What I love about it is that it’s really warm, and it’s got something of the history of women in it, and that’s when I was thinking of... amber. I love the smell of amber. My mother used to wear amber and she didn’t wear anything except these amber beads. She was the 70s girl. She was a hippy and she ran away from home and kind of rebelled against the system. And I felt that Azzi captured the dignity and the layer of intrigue that most women have from going through stuff, but in a very refined way.'

                text:'Azzi. This is where it gets interesting. It’s going to be personal to Bella because nobody will understand that personal ability, but what’s interesting is that we started with the other fragrances — Je t’aime Jane, Ginsberg is God and 1970 — which were very much based on Bella’s work, so we had the introduction to Bella, her designs, and the concepts, and the visualisations. And actually, that was very much the beginning of our work together, but we would discuss Bella’s private life and things like that, so it was an organic transition, literally. When Bella talks about Ginsberg is God, you get that tousle-haired poet/writer look that’s always timelessly cool and trendy, and deliciously gorgeous, and that feeling of heritage. The scent totally portrays that; it’s creative and intelligent, but it has this edginess to it, because that look does have that edginess toit. When you wear it, you feel like that. The whole scent has a sense of style to it, just like the vision that Bella has. With Je t’aime Jane, that was the most feminine of our conversations, and when you do actually imagine it, she’s got a baby but she’s got bare legs and she’s playing a guitar. It’s that simple, incredible life where you only care about the things that really matter to you. You create your own world around you, rather than it being created for you. And that’s very powerful, because most women don’t think like that. In general, if you look at women in the world, they tend to follow their man and be supportive, and this and that. But there’s something about this particular vision — an independence to it. That’s why Je t’aime Jane smells really sexy, but in a sort of beautiful, soft, intelligent way. She knows what’s right and wrong in her world, so it’s just having that kind of thought process put into a scent, so when you wear it, you feel like that. With 1970, it’s really exactly as Bella described it, but I added in more of a girl, wearing a halter-neck dress, with a lot of skin showing, so it’s that hedonistic feeling where you just know she’s going to have the best time of her life through the night. And you want that scent to last all night, so we wanted it to smell really exotic and hedonistic — that feeling of 1970s. It’s my favourite era.'

And that mixture of glamour and grunge, I love both and I love the tension between them. And I remember in the 70s, seeing everyone all glam rock, and then seeing punk, it was just the way to go. I remember the first time it was cool to be young, instead of it just being idiotic to be young and having no power. Suddenly, somehow, you had this power to frighten people just by what you were wearing. People were scared of teenagers. It was interesting to see the power of clothes and how much they could affect people.'

They’re actually quite connected, because you’re very psychological as well, and you see how people dress, and the power and the aura they have as they walk past you. I have the same with smell. It’s like a love affair withperfume. Sometimes you instantly think, “I’m going to love this.” There’s also a nostalgic element to this fragrance. It has a soft, powdery comfort note, and that’s a mixture of tonka and patchouli. Patchouli is a really earthy, wet note, which is so delicious and very addictive.'

I ended up in fashion because I wanted to get into The Blitz. To pass the scrutiny of Steve Strange you had to look the part, so with an added emphasis on dressing up, I eventually started designing again, but with more intensity and purpose.  I just made it up as I went along, wrapping the fabric around myself. My first sleeve pattern was a free-drawn line in the shape of a bent arm, which I attached to the body by eyelets.  I never wanted to be the same as everyone else, I was never into trends. I was just creating a look for myself. I was, however, unwittingly making clothes that others loved and wanted to wear, and because they were different they were snapped up by all the magazines.  At that time, in the 80s, it was amazing being a young designer because all the Americans would come over with lots of money for the sole purpose of buying London “creations” — the more unusual the better. And although there were many individual boutiques stocking up, the big stores like Bloomingdale’s and Bendel’s in New York were among the first to place orders.  One of my first direct customers was Ian Astbury of The Cult. He used to squeeze into my tops and cut the arms off.  I felt like a superhero when he named me as his favourite designer in Just-17 magazine. I’d just started and The Cult were like gods.'

My birthday is on the 4th of January, so she was throwing a party for me. On the 2nd her phone rang, and I answered, unaware it was for me. This was 1990, pre-mobiles, so I must have left a message on my answering machine, saying where I could be reached. It was someone from the Terry Wogan Show, saying they wanted me, along with Mark McManus (Taggart), to appear live on the show in London on the 5th. I said, “I’m really sorry, but my sister has organised a party for me,” and I put the phone down. Angela was looking at me in disbelief, asking what I’d just turned down, she couldn’t believe it, she said: “It’s Terry Wogan, it’s one of the top shows on TV. Call them back and we can have the party tomorrow!” But I didn’t have the number, and you couldn’t dial 1471 or Google it. Next minute, the phone rang again. “How about if we pay your fare?” I was like, “Oh, hi there. Well, if you throw in a bottle of champagne, we could have a deal.” She said, “Oh, it’s normally just red or white, but I suppose we could make an exception.” '

I couldn’t believe it. Although I’m not politically outspoken, I say a lot through my work: in 2010, there was my blood soaked “War Bride” dress that had bones attached by delicate silk ribbons to the back train, representing the tin cans tied to the back of the wedding car. There was also my S.O.S collection in 2013, which had nurses dressed in garments made from bandaging. The previous show was military style, the first outfit had a dirtied apron with “The Soils of War” scrawled in blood and dirt down the back, but this time, I wasn’t showing; I’d taken a time-out to try and get a selling collection together. It was such bad timing, but doing this for Amnesty meant everything to me.  I knew I had to do something. Within an hour, I had my title COURAGE, inspired by when I’d seen them exit prison — still defiant and more or less saying, “Putin we’re still after your ass.” I’dalso completely visualised the show. All Amnesty had asked for was a balaclava to be worn on the catwalk, but I wanted to fully celebrate Pussy Riot and gay culture. I had ten garments that had somehow never made it onto my catwalk and I conditioned myself to have two hours’ sleep a night to design and make a further ten. No one saw me for three weeks. I was given a slot on the first day of Fashion Week, appropriately Valentine’s Day, and I used the Amnesty slogan as a second title “Love Is a Human Right”. My first outfits went down the catwalk with placards saying “This is a Dedication to Pussy Riot” and “This Collection is Not for Sale”.'

                text:'Growing up, when I was sussing out what beauty meant to me, I consciously and subconsciously referred to various sources: female relatives, fashion magazines, older girls at school, pornography, news readers, MTV. On cinema screens there was Hollywood beauty, which was very different to French beauty — wholesome Farrah Fawcett with her blonde flicks versus Béatrice Dalle with her ashen smoker’s skin, coal dark hair and soul, and buck teeth bursting out of an obscenely sexy mouth. The models of womanhood weren’t always precisely pretty. The nearly naked yet sexless Barbie doll women on Miss World (really and truly a thing when I was a teenager in the 80s) were technically beauties, but I aspired to a sequence of more abandoned and flawed ideals of womanhood. From the sweaty Sloane Rangers dancing on tables, to the boss-eyed ravers in high top trainers, boiler suits and bra tops with their hair scraped up in a Croydon facelift, the women I loved were a bit of a mess but having a ball.'

Racial diversity was a novelty and gay people were treated like a joke, at best. However, what I miss about the past is the way that beauty came bundled up with flaws. I had my share of body image troubles and low self-esteem. A flick through a magazine could have me resolved to eat nothing but celery and cottage cheese for the rest of my life, but — and this is key — once I’d closed it, real life returned.'

Today the internet is an amazing thing, and it is also home to billions of pouting narcissists trying to convince me that they are living The Perfect Life. As our digital lives enmesh completely with our physical reality, seeing flaws and pores is becoming harder. The fashion bloggers, with their nearly identical street style and excessively filtered existence, might have millions and millions of followers, but they’re boring. The pop stars might have tats and Geordie accents, but they never sweat or thrash about onstage. It’s all so choreographed and banal.'

Every moment of my waking hours I’m invaded by perfected idealised versions of not just my friends and “friends” — you know, the people you are connected to on social networks but couldn’t actually identify in a police line up — but also the countless digital media stars who pose with their green juices and lap dogs, who rub out spots, filter out their wrinkles and put a triangle of air at the tops of their legs. Even Beyoncé isn’t immune to doctoring her Instagram posts. Her brand of showbiz “feminism”, it seems, requires a gap between left and right thigh. Most of these people are funded by big companies with something to sell, or have turned themselves into personal brands. You can’t hashtag: #wasted #upallnight or #crispbinge if your banner ads are paid for by a multinational corporation phobic of anything remotely naughty. No wonder Lena Dunham is such a huge star. She’s the only flawed person left on the internet.'

Wolf’s basic argument is that the more women have gained power and made headway, the narrower and stricter standards of female beauty have become. One generation on, and The Beauty Myth is more ferocious than ever. There’s an obsessive selfie culture, which revolves around looking good and pretty in a way that makes Debbie Harry’s iconic dry bleached hair and street hooker style anathema to a 16-year-old girl looking for some style leads.'

                text:'I’ve spent a decade on social networks now and certainly watched beauty norms get narrower. No one wants to look like a punk any more. The ideal is the physique of a girl on the cusp of womanhood, with the pout and eyes of a plump toddler, the hair, tits and ass of a woman in her fertile prime, and the ankles of a new born foal. This physique, which is unattainable by natural means for all but a freakish few, is far from normal. And yet it is normal to want to look this way. Boob jobs and syringes full of filler can go some way, as can mad action at the gym, along with a lot of posing effort. It all adds up to a girl with a frozen face, big puffy cheeks, a rubber ring for lips and two melons crammed into a bikini. This is an ideal in the age of emancipated women?'

It’s about humour, posture, style, intelligence, wealth, education, eccentricity, kindness, vulnerability, sex appeal, the scent of your hair, the ease with which you dance, a chipped tooth — the list is endless. I’m 45 now, and I’d love to say I’m completely at ease with myself and my appearance. In all honesty, I can’t. But I have grown to realise that the things that are ugly about me are also who I am.'

The topography of beauty is a precise thing, which can be mapped out: the proportions of the eyes and their distance from each other and the cheekbones, nose and chin (not chins). Beauty is... Miranda Kerr, it isn’t my long thin horse face with chronic dark circles under my eyes. But beauty is not everything that makes a human attractive and interesting to others, nor is it the only foundation on which to build self-esteem. In fact, as a foundation for self-esteem it is the very metaphorical sand, which inevitably will erode while other aspects of self endure.'
